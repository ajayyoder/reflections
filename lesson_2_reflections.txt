What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, it has no commits. You must manually add the first commit. You need to
	initialize a repository because before you do so there is no .git file that stores the repository's info

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area keeps track of what files will be added to the next commit. That commit is added to the reposiory
	with git commit. The working directory is the name for the directory that contains the files that the repository is 
	keeping track of.
